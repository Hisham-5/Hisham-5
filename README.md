## Hi there 👋


**Hisham-5/Hisham-5** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I’m currently working on a few basic Python programs, because I'm literally in 11th.
- I’m currently learning a bit of Python, using it to make games and stuff. Not much, just basic 🙂.
- I wanna work with someone with exeperience, so I could get ahead of me peers and get me a good head start 🙃.
- How to reach me: hishammohiuddin5@gmail.com 
- Pronouns: he/him 😄
- Fun fact: Totally irrelvant and doesn't make a difference, and doesn't matter, but my IQ is 137. (Doesn't matter btw, it's useless, accordin' to someone trust-worthy.)
